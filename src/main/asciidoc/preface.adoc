= Preface

The Spring Data for Apache Solr project applies core Spring concepts to the development of solutions by using the Apache Solr Search Engine. We provide a "`template`" as a high-level abstraction for storing and querying documents. You may notice similarities to the MongoDB support in the Spring Framework.
